# Document-segmentation-TP

## XY cut
1. "RescusiveXYCut.m" is the main file of this algorithm. It can use the "recusiveYCut.m" function to seperate a document in Y direction or the "recusiveCut.m" function to seperate a document in both X and Y direction.
2. When function "recusiveYCut.m" is called, the result are figures which are cutted recusivly from the input figure in Y direction.
3. When function "recusiveCut.m" is called, it will cause a bug and the program will stop in the middle 

## RLSA
1. "RLSA.m" is the only file of this algorithm.   
2. The output of this file are three figures: figure 1 shows of the RLSA applied in Y direction, figure 2 shows of the RLSA applied in X direction, and figure 3 shows a combined result of figure 1 and figure 2.
